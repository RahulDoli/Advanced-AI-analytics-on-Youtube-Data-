In my project "YouTube Trending Video Analysis & Prediction," I delved into the intricacies of YouTube's trending video data, employing a blend of data science techniques across 140 cells, with a focus on 72 code executions. The project initiated with vital library imports, setting the stage for comprehensive data manipulation and analysis. My approach included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns, and applying natural language processing (NLP) to assess video titles and descriptions for underlying themes. The crux of the project was predictive modeling, where I utilized Random Forest Regression to predict video virality based on initial performance indicators, assessing model efficacy through metrics like MSE and MAE. This endeavor, richly documented for clarity, not only sharpened my analytical skills but also provided deep insights into factors influencing video popularity on YouTube, encapsulating a holistic view of content dynamics within the platform.
